# AI Playground üõ†Ô∏èü§ñ

Welcome to the **AI Playground**, a space where creativity meets cutting-edge technology. This repository is my personal collection of experiments, prototypes, and tools created or refined using AI-powered code generation platforms like [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude) and [v0](https://v0.dev/).

Each project here captures a snapshot of my daily experimentation journey‚Äîshowcasing the immense potential of AI in software engineering while reflecting my growth in exploring new tools and techniques.

## üåü Vision
The **AI Playground** is more than just a repository; it‚Äôs an evolving journey exploring:
- The art of **prototyping**.
- The power of **AI-assisted development**.
- How tools like Claude and v0 can revolutionize the way we build software.

This initiative aligns with my broader exploration into blending software engineering with product thinking to create innovative solutions.

## ‚ú® Motivation
As a software engineer with a passion for product development, I‚Äôve always been curious about the potential of AI to streamline and enhance the creative process. Previously, I relied heavily on tools like **GitHub Copilot** and **ChatGPT** to support development tasks. Now, I‚Äôm diving deeper into **prototyping ideas**, exploring how tools like Claude and v0 can assist in bringing creative concepts to life.

Think of this repository as a **daily experimentation journal**, where every project reflects a step forward‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs learning from challenges, celebrating small victories, or sparking new ideas.

## üìÇ Projects
Every project in this repository includes:
- **Prompts**: The exact inputs used to generate or refine the code.
- **Screenshots**: Visual snapshots of the journey and outcomes.
- **Lessons Learned**: Key takeaways and challenges encountered.
- **Future Ideas**: Potential avenues for improvement or further exploration.

Browse through the projects to see how AI can turn ideas into reality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
- **Claude**: A conversational AI that aids in generating, debugging, and refining code. I used it for prototyping with UI. 
- **v0**: A prototyping tool designed for building and iterating quickly with AI assistance. I used it for prototyping with UI and I am aiming also to explore backend and integration. 
- **ChatGPT**: Chat gpt :). I am using it for learning requirement writings, discussions, brainstorming.
- **React** and **Next.js**: Frameworks I use regularly to create and refine prototypes.
- **GitHub Copilot** and **Intellij Code Assistant**: Tools I previously leveraged for development tasks in IDEs.

## üìà Why Explore This Repository?
- Get inspired by the potential of **AI-driven development**.
- Dive into real-world examples of **prototyping with AI**.
- Learn from documented insights and challenges.
- Spark ideas for your own AI-assisted projects.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Next?
The journey doesn‚Äôt stop here! Future updates will include:
- New experiments with emerging tools.
- Deeper dives into **lessons learned**.
- Expanding the repository to include more ambitious AI-powered projects.
